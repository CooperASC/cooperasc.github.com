## What We Do

### Communication
Art Student Council serves to instigate communication between the art student body and the wider community. To accomplish this, Art Student Council must a) both receive factual information and disperse it, b) have a continual and unbiased line of communication with our peers. 

### Community Building
Art Student Council serves to create a rich community experience amongst our peers that exists outside of our academic life. This is accomplished through integrating the freshmen into the broader student body, holding events for the whole School of Art, and maintaining a strong link between the Art students and groups such as the Art Schoolâ€™s Administration, Engineering and Architecture Schools, Alumni, and the local community. 

### Academic Integrity
Art Student Council has a responsibility to ensure that the academic programs in the School of Art hold true to the needs and integrity of the student body. 

### Student Council Identity
Art Student Council must create and maintain an identity that reflects its current members.
In order to maintain this identity, Art Student Council keeps meeting minutes, fundraises for future student councils, is rigorous, has a unified voice and a public presence.
