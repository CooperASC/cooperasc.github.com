## Full, Public History

You can see a full log of changes to this site on [our Github](https://github.com/CooperASC/cooperasc.github.com/commits/master). For example, here is the history of [this page](https://github.com/CooperASC/cooperasc.github.com/commits/master/_posts/about/0100-01-01-transparency.md). Most [notes](/notes) pages include a sidebar providing easy access to the document's history, as well as an online text editor that allows you to submit suggested changes. 

Unlike other parts of Cooper's governance which act only as entities (e.g. "The Board") or only as individuals (e.g. "The President"), we believe that individual and group responsibilities are not mutually exclusive. Generating a public record of our individual contributions while we work strengthens our accountability and allows us to work together asynchronously. For example, we used our website to [collaboratively author](https://github.com/CooperASC/cooperasc.github.com/commits/master/_posts/notes/2013-02-13-bharucha-response.md) a [letter to the administration](http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2013/02/13/bharucha-response/) which we then ratified and published.

## Living Documents

The documents on this site are living documents, meaning they are likely to change over time. In response to our administration's slow, bureaucractic processes of approval that have often left us out of touch, we strive to publish information as soon as possible and then improve it over time. Anyone on Student Council may edit any document at any time, and the public is also invited to suggest edits for us to approve. This principle of [eventual consistency](http://prose.io/help/eventually-consistent.html) has been articulated nicely by a group of programmers called Prose:

> Most things in life are not perfect. That’s also true for your writings. Every writer, journalist or scientist can tell you about it. There will always be room for improvement.

> Essentially, there are two ways you can approach this problem:

> 1. Invest an infinite amount of time into reviewing before getting a supposedly perfect text out of the door.
> 2. Publish early and continuously improve your content once it’s out, ideally with the help of your readers.

> Much like in the spirit of Open Source development, we claim that continuously improving content in the open leads to better results than applying the best review process available.

## Types of Notes

### Full Transcripts

Because of the labor involved in recording and transcribing long meetings, Student Council does not typically post word-by-word meeting transcripts.

### Internal Minutes

Most meetings at Cooper appoint a member of the group to take official minutes. These minutes are typiccally made available _only_ to invited members and are reviewed at the following meeting for corrections before being archived.

### Public Notes

Unless otherwise noted, meeting content put out by Student Council takes the form of notes. Student Council notes are distinct from transcripts or official meeting minutes in that they are written by students, made available publicly on this website, and are not necessarily reviewed by the meeting members before being posted. While we attempt to convey the tone and content of meetings we attend as accurately as we can — and we often work together to not miss anything — our notes ultimately paraphrase conversations and present things from the representative's point of view. If you have questions or concerns about how somebody is represented in our notes, get in touch with the notetaker by clicking their name at the top of the page, or email all of Student Council at [cuartcouncil@gmail.com](mailto:cuartcouncil@gmail.com).

### Public Pseudonymous Notes

When individuals feel like they might be put at risk by having something they said publicly attributed to them but agree that the meeting notes are important to make public, Student Council may publish pseudonymous notes which indentify speakers by group rather than name.

### No Public Notes

While Student Council advocates for increased transparency at Cooper Union, we recognize that there are risks to openness which must be handled with tact. If a meeting group asks Student Council to _not_ publish notes, we will honor their request while making the absence of notes explicit on our website.

## Further Reading on Transparency

Since [launching our website in October 2012](https://github.com/CooperASC/cooperasc.github.com/commit/fb9ccaff5b4185fb6179b70cb8e5add93e23bb3a), we've read and talked a lot about the complexities of transparency in governance. Here are selected readings on the importance of transparency and open data as well as the pitfalls and limitations:
