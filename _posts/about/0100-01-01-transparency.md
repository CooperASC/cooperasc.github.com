## Degrees of Transparency

### Full Transcripts

Because of the labor involved in recording and transcribing long meetings, Student Council does not post word-by-word meeting transcripts.

### Internal Minutes

Most meetings at Cooper appoint a member of the group to take official minutes. These minutes are typiccally made available _only_ to invited members and are reviewed at the following meeting for corrections before being archived.

### Public Notes

Unless otherwise noted, meeting content put out by Student Council takes the form of notes. Student Council notes are distinct from transcripts or official meeting minutes in that they are written by students, made available publicly on this website, and are not necessarily reviewed by the meeting members before being posted. While we attempt to convey the tone and content of meetings we attend as accurately as we can — and we often work together to not miss anything — our notes ultimately paraphrase conversations and present things from the representative's point of view. If you have questions or concerns about how somebody is represented in our notes, get in touch with the notetaker by clicking their name at the top of the page, or email all of Student Council at [cuartcouncil@gmail.com](mailto:cuartcouncil@gmail.com).

### Public Pseudonymous Notes

When individuals feel like they might be put at risk by having something they said publicly attributed to them but agree that the meeting notes are important to make public, Student Council may publish pseudonymous notes which indentify speakers by group rather than name.

### No Public Notes

While Student Council advocates for increased transparency at Cooper Union, we recognize that there are risks to openness which must be handled with tact. If a meeting group asks Student Council to _not_ publish notes, we will honor their request.

## Further Reading on Transparency

Since [launching our website in October 2012](https://github.com/CooperASC/cooperasc.github.com/commit/fb9ccaff5b4185fb6179b70cb8e5add93e23bb3a), we've read and talked a lot about the complexities of transparency in governance. Here are selected readings on the importance of transparency and open data as well as pitfalls and limitations:
