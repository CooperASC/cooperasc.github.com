**This is a draft / work in progress.**

Notes are like minutes but less formal. Instead of striving for objectivity they are presented from the representative's point of view.

The notes are paraphrased. We've attempted to convey the conversation's tone and content as accurately as we can, and have worked together to not miss anything, but we do not want to misrepresent anyone.

We can make corrections after publishing and be transparent and not ashamed about it. We can put people with questions in touch with those being paraphrased.

If you weren't in the room wouldn't you have wanted to know what went down?

Editing: It's hard, time-consuming work, and a slippery slope of subjectivity. It's fine to include jokes and random remarks from a discussion. One person's trash is another's treasure. Let's get the info out there.
