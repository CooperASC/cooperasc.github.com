#Interschool Meeting: 
##Ratifying CU Governance     

**Attendance:** Andrew Rehayem (1st year Eng.), Andy Overton (1st year Art), Mike, Caleb Wang, Bob Estrin, Che Perez, Asher Mones    

BE: Discussed interschool statement started during JSC Meeting (last month)  
AR: the way the statement functions is based on prob. of BOT not adressing going back to a free tuition based school  
BE: Things are dif. but mismanagement has been an issue; may destroy school; focus should   be pointing out specific issues in leadership and getting more student rep in the goveranance.   
AR: 1. want to tell board this model is not what we consider stable going into the future. energy should be put into model which perpetuates no tuition policy  
BE: 3rd party analysts gave suggestions and BOT says 50% across the board. how is this indicitative of the 2 year work the 3rd parties have been paid to complete.
people who are making decisions aren't considering the thoughts of their constituents.   

*analysts say that charging more than 25% is debilitating* [needs to be checked]    

CP: it was between the faculty and students as well  
AM: would hurt the quality of applicants  

BE: anyone who is applying is waying options.  
competing in market of higher edu. if you raise it too much the quality of app. tapers off.   

AM: Way that decision was delivered was not rep. of the advice given to faculty
admin is not thinking about a mission for the school.   

CP: we can argue this as an ideological issue, b the leadership sets the ideology.   

AR: we need a concise statement among us. Want draft tonight.  

CW: throw out everything we want to hit and then break up into groups to narrow it down  

BE: started drafting doc. in the arch. school --> we have a pretty worked statement. It has been advised by prof's.   
-purpose is to frame the problem as we see it and then states what we would like to see.   
-hope would be that we could work out a few things of what we would be interested in seeing which may be a more difficult convo.
