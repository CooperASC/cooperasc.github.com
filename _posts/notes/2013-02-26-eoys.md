##EOYS IDEAS!

What is your vision for this year's End of the Year show? We need to plan it now. 

How can we have a show as interesting as last year without doing a repeat?

In a meeting, faculty suggested that one structure, perhaps, could be 'teams' of students with faculty advisors setting up different parts of the building(s).

This is our opportunity to show the community outside of Cooper what we do at Cooper: teach, make art, build community....? 

What do you want to see? What do you want to do?
---------------------------------------------

FREE SCHOOL INSIDE THE SCHOOL///PUBLIC
(this is something we talked about some last year, but how can we do it this year? Should the lecture content be related, in some way, to Cooper? Topics around Cooper? or should we offer a class on doing your taxes? How would it, then, be different from trade school or BHQFU?)

How can we get freshmen and sophomores super involved? 

Alum involvement? What kind?
