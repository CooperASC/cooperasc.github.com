##EOYS IDEAS!

What is your vision for this year's End of the Year show? We need to plan it now. 

How can we have a show as interesting as last year without doing a repeat?

In a meeting, faculty suggested that one structure, perhaps, could be 'teams' of students with faculty advisors setting up different parts of the building(s).

This is our opportunity to show the community outside of Cooper what we do at Cooper: teach, make art, build community....? 

What do you want to see? What do you want to do?
