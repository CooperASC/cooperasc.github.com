An open letter to the community regarding our concern about President Bharucha's mounting paranoia:
Increasingly President Bharucha is showing us that he is very paranoid. He has increased building security (#s here, does anyone know how many security guards have been added and at what times. At least three different things 1: for checking ids, which Dean Lemiesz asked for 2: for certain meetings where board members are present and 3: when the occupiers were upstairs 4. making rounds around the building), 
President Bharucha had security guards go and check the dorm rooms that have windows overlooking the Hamilton Fish House (rumour?).
Poster Policy -- he tried to go after individuals who made inflammatory posters / protest posters, and now the policy is unneccesarily strict on ALL types of posters.
I heard he checks the save cooper facebook like every night that is also a rumor (kristi writing this hello)
New cameras were installed today (2/19) on at least the 2nd floor--not sure details but they look fancier than the old ones. (still kristi writing sorry i'm turning this into a rumour mill)
Doesn't leave the fishhouse during heated times bc he's scared (rumorish) but the point is that paranoia keeping him from doing work.
Board Meetings have been relocated from LL101



He has referred to the creation of a "mob mentality" in the art school, indicating that he believes that, at any moment, the school could erupt into violence. He's also made comments to art faculty that they need to "civilize" their students, indicating that he thinks we're uncivilized. Students (spokes, etc, possibly) have made written statements of community agreements of non-violence. The lock-in people were extremely clear about safety concerns. etc. 

These beliefs concern us because the actions taken and the things he has said simply are not an accurate representation and response to the things actually going on at the school. 

This concerns us a great deal because President Bharucha is the face of The Cooper Union and we feel that if these are the things he believes and feels, his representation of the school, the student body, and the temperature of the school to both the Board of Trustees and potential and long-time donors is far from accurate. We are concerned that President Bharucha is taking too much burden onto himself and is, as a result, causing him too much stress.
