School of Art Faculty Meeting Feb 5 2013 9:00 AM Peter Cooper Suite

**Unless it’s in quotes I’m totally paraphrasing, I’m trying to be as accurate as I can in my note taking and not miss anything but don’t want to mis represent anyone either Just trying to pick up on the main idea of everyone’s comments and convey the mood of the conversation as succinctly / accurately as possible**

meeting starts ~9:15 when Jamshed and the 3 Trustees arrive

Saskia gives opening welcomes, thanks them for coming.

Epstein: We are here mostly because we want to hear why there was this change about how things were going with the art faculty (re: Art Faculty’s letter that went out last week)

Bos talks about Cooper being a beacon and an important place in the current moment in higher education.

Epstein: We unfortunately have to make changes, we want to do this as painlessly as possible, we have to find out why you aren’t cooperating with where we’re going. In regards to tuition - I see no other way out. If a mistake was made it was the Board in the 70’s--a lot was lost, green camp for example. They had the oppurtunity then to change things. If they had given, say, 75 or 80% scholarships then, we wouldn’t be in nearly such a bad place now. And I don’t blame the boards since then, they have worked hard, always had hope we could recover.

Bos: Let’s talk about have we done everything, exhausted all options for solving this problem.

Epstein: People are not happy about the idea of charging tuition but we put this out there to faculty, who are very bright to solve this, and we haven’t heard other solutions. I’m willing to listen

Osinski: There was a shift when the faculty were asked to both solve the financial problems and create excellent academic programs. The 2 do not neccesarily go together. Up until this year, the faculty has not been in charge of the finances of the school. It’s not up to us to solve this, especially looking at these types of programs elsewhere.

Epstein: Most institutions have programs which raise revenue

Osinski: Most institutions have students and faculty representatives on their Boards.

Epstein: This issue of representation--we have meetings with students, there is a group of us which meets with students. Students cannot fit into the existing structure / model of the Board. They can talk to us, if students can’t work out their representation, it’s not my problem, not the fault of the Board.

Eagleton: The issue is that those meetings just don’t cut it. It’s not the same kind of access, we can show a group of you student perspectives in those small meetings, but we don’t know what happens in Board meetings. Student representation would open that channel.

Epstein: There are 2 issues with that: 1. Confidentiality, 2. Conflict of Interest. For example we talk about union issues. Even the Alumni Council reps that are there are bound by confidentiality. Even if you had reps there they could not go back and tell people what happens.

Eagleton: Obviously other schools have figured this out.

Epstein: Most of those are public.

Eagleton: Some are private.

Epstein: Yes, well, this is a small school with a different level of access--

Ashford: In this moment of crisis, if we are really being threatened as we are, if that’s all true, shouldn’t we consider these concerns of representation. In our letter we have made it clear that we are ready & willing to completely change the game. We can’t just go on business as usual. And I was here in 76 when they gave away Green Camp, I’ve seen all that has happened and changed--Now this is the time to do something different.

Epstein: Isn’t what Jamshed is asking for radically different?

Osinski: We’ve had threats of a school closing, no idea what anyone’s intentions are in asking us to do these tasks, we want to know what the trustees vision is

Driscol: We have to be financially sustainable. Jamshed has engaged the community. We don’t have a vision of the outcome, we’re looking to everyone to help us find it.

Bordo: As alums, you must understand the value of your contract of your scholarship. I have issue with revenue generating programs being a kind of Trojan Horse. Graduate education is on the downswing, not the upswing. We need to imagine the pedagocial future of the school, not just the tuition free part. The whole culture, admissions, it makes a contract in the classroom. What kind of institution do you envision w/o this asset?

Epstein: A sustainable one. We have bills to pay. It’s just like a business, financially. There are 2 things that make Cooper special: The scholarship, and excellence. Right now, we can’t have both.

Bordo: They are the same. There is something here to sustain. Reinvention ≠ expansion. “Reinvention has been a threat this last year”

Epstein: Example. Lets look at St Marks Bookstore. We’ve heard similar things about what they do for the community. Steps to keep it alive, but it’s not sustainable! And I want to address this myth I often hear about the New Building that it cost the school so much money. It is not the reason we are in this hole, we raised money for it, it will continue to generate money for us in the future. What’s ruining us is not the NAB, it’s the defecit.

Ashford: In terms of looking at Cooper’s finances as a busines--how do you evalute assets that are symbolic? Giving away our biggest asset would be giving away philanthropic oppurtunities, etc.

Epstein: We’re not talking about eliminating the scholarship, just reducing it. Look at Berea, another free school. They only admit poor students and those students have to work.

Ashford: Our students could do that! We like that kind of thinking.

Epstein: We can’t just lay off staff and have students work, it doesn’t work like that.

Osinski: Okay, but there’s a million things students could do, people are willing to do things.

Raad: I want to go back to this issue of symbolic assets—

Driscoll: How do we pay the bills with symbolic assets?

Ashford: That is the question we need to be asking: how do we leverage it into $

Driscoll: It’s frustrating. The outside community isn’t neccesarily impressed by “free for rich kids”

Raad: Why is that a problem? Why should we give to rich kids? Can you tell me?

Driscoll: It’s the meritocracy—

Raad: What does that mean to you? Tell me what meritocracy means to you

Driscoll: It means a not strings attached oppurtunity to feel good about themselves, a great intellectual exercise.

Raad: I ask because I have a similar project, and part of my mission is explaining to donors why they should donate. If you can’t even tell the story, we’re in more trouble than we think.

Epstein: If we had $1billion we wouldn’t even be having this conversation. We can ask ourselves: what was Peter Cooper’s mission–

Raad: We can ask how do we better what Peter Cooper had done. “We’ve bettered the model, I want to keep bettering it”

Bordo: Today it is more democratic, it’s a more contemporary way of running things. This is a special situation, one that has been bettered over 100 years.

Epstein: You know, the meritocracy is filtered, it’s filtered for gender, race, etc..

Hayes: My experiences with admissions have been a total revelation. And the kinds of classes we can build here because of admissions are 30x more rich than any other institution I know. In admissions, we talk about how merit is constituted, we look at people as individuals with a voice.

Raad: In admissions we unpack word after word, we recruit people who might not have even thought of going to art school, it is an astounding process, a more sophisticated analysis of what merit is.

Epstein: I agree and I don’t see how some of those people paying would change that.

Hayes: Admissions is one place where I can clearly feel the symbolic value as monetary value. We don’t have to convince people to come here, with good labs, etc. At other schools you see them pouring money into luring students.

Epstein: If my parents had to pay, it wouldn’t have changed my choice to be here.

Hayes: I have talked to students, there are students here that can’t have that conversation with thier parents. I’ve heard people say that w/o COoper they wouldn’t be at college.

Driscoll: You haven’t answered how do we pay for it?

Hayes: We took this charge very seriously. We went through this process and concluded that we couldn’t maintain to excellence of the programs if there’s tuition.

Driscoll: Why? Because you would be stretched too thin?

Ashford: Yes, but it’s more that it creates a different context. As someone who has seen things get given away, can cannot give this asset away. And we feel that this asset has not been fully exploited. If we give it away what will we get back? $3 milliion from a summer school?! Is that the bottom line?

Epstein: I think one of the strongest assetts is the students. I get that they’re great but what we’re facing is we don’t have enough money. We have donors who ask ‘why should I give this kid money, his parents make more than I do’

Eagleton: I had a meeting with development a few weeks ago, and I asked how students could help reach out to alumni, and they said ‘Oh, that’s too hard.” I think the biggest mistake is that students aren’t being involved in the fundraising, if students are biggest asset, why aren’t students at events, speaking with donors?

Epstein: The alumni give back rate at Cooper is very low. Listen, I spoke with one student who said “If I give back it wasn’t a scholarship”. That’s the quote. From a student.

Gleeson: It’s shocking to me that you (to trustees) didn’t know about our admissions process. We should have faculty reps to the Academic Affairs committee of the Board.

Jamshed: You do

Gleeson: Who? Who is our rep here?

Jamshed: You have reps from the Senate

Essl: It is the executive committee of the Senate that gets invited to those meetings, this is not necessarily a faculty member, for a while it was Tom Michelli, not a faculty member. A senate rep ≠ a faculty rep. Show of hands here who has been invited to an academic affairs meeting (no one)

Jenny: If development is saying we just can’t because it is too hard–

Jamshed: I will talk to them

Gleeson: There are more issues of representation. The School of Art was not involved in the presidential search

Jamshed: The  faculty we re invited to the Board Meeting in December

Gleeson: We also have not talked about cost reduction.

Jamshed: We can’t decide that for you, it has to be a local decision. I don’t see cost reduction in your proposal

Bos: We are tlaking about a question of how to leverage this main asset with development

Driscoll: We should explore that. I see passion from the faculty.

Bos: We have not yet seen free tuition as the main campaign from development.

Epstein: Most schools get $ from Alumni, our alumni base is small and not as rich as other schools. We’ve never gotten huge gifts.

Bordo: Isn’t that what reinvention is about? Cultural change is work. Students are talking about participating. That’s reinvention.

Raad: Our students do this on thier own. They want to give back to the community. For example, insist on classes being open (IDS)

Epstein: That doesn’t pay the bills. There was this student donation drive where some students paid $0.01. (Referring to last years 100% student donation drive) I guess because they thought it was cute to donate 1 penny. And I have to tell donors that our students think their education is worth one penny.

Jamshed: Donors ask about these things.

Raad: What is financially sustainable vs. idealogical sustainable? We feel that the idealogy is worth much more. I’m going to leave this room having met some people who can’t make the case for this

Driscoll: We’ve told the story–

Raad: You can’t tell it to me! Right now! Tell me the argument! I do this in Beirut. If I can do it for 12 students you should be able to do it for 100. You can’t make this argument.

Driscoll: If a donor doesn’t write a check, the story doesn’t matter.

Ashford: Why don’t we meet with other people we work with from other institutions--MoMa, ICP, etc., who regularly have to tell their story to raise money? There is ‘project oriented philanthropy’, as Jamshed has explained to us in past meetings. These people could share with us, the people who have been making symbolic capital for them for the last 30 years. We need to tap this assett with the Art World!

Epstein: There is a famous artist whose child went here recently who did not donate a penny.

Ashford: Who talked to them!?

Epstein: ….

Ashford: That’s the problem! It does not matter what they have, it’s who makes the call.

Hayes: We are an anomaly. We’re not naive about the work it would take to do this.

Ashford: We’re willing to do the work. We want to do the work.

Jamshed: We do that work every day

Bos: We should do it more together. There was this Houston event that I was not invited to with donors that could have been a lovely event with faculty where we could leverage this energy. I would like to be more involved

Hayes: I want to say that our letter, this statement isn’t intended to be a wrench--we’re not throwing a wrench at you. It is to be a part of, with our expertise, this conversation.

Osinski: We also need to look outside of education programs. If we installed cigarette machines in this building we would make so much money (Laughter)

Gollan: It’s a joke, and we’re laughing but I would consider a cigarette machine a lot less dangerous than charging tuition.

Jamshed: Getting commercial revenue is on the table and continues to be.

Raad: We’re not deaf to the finances. We have $40 million from the Chrysler building coming in. Reinvention means reassessing ‘What is a college’ This is an incredible opportunity. But that’s not what we’re hearing, the $40 million, we’re hearing ‘we’re short $17 million’

Jamshed: You can’t just downsize the institution. If solutions come organically, we would love that.

Ellis: What do you mean ‘organically’?

Jamshed: I mean I can’t discuss terms and conditions of employment, it would have to come through your bargaining units. Talks about employment numbers, compares to other schools (I got a little lost here for a minute)

Osinski: You can’t compare Cooper’s numbers to RISD or Columbia. We’ve put a lot of $ into these outside consultants. I feel that was a total waste of $. We did all of this work for no money, we pay them millions, they produce nothing.

Epstein: The trustees do this for free too, and we donate. Ok we have $40 million. Lets be blunt. That’s a third our budget. What three of you will walk away right now?

Raad: That is a false choice

Gleeson: The faculty spends countless hours on admissions and we do not get paid for this work

Epstein: So there’s no savings, nothing to cut.

Raad: We need everyone, faculty, staff, students, alumni, the unions, to come together if peoples’ salaries are an issue. They all need to be a part of the solution.

deMenil: I have to leave, but if you come up with a plan with Architecture and Engineering, I would listen to that. (Leaves)

Epstein: What you’re saying makes sense, but it’s not doable. The benefits faculty have here are really generous as well, compared to other schools.

Jamshed: And health care should be just, we should ensure that it is affordable to people who work here.

Ashford: Yes, but lets be real, 80% of classes in the school of Art are taught by uninsured faculty. The whole reason for this meeting is to say that we’re willing to start from scratch to reimagine solving this.

Driscoll: There are long and short term issues. We need a short term solution now.

Raad: There were talks of going to the Attorney General for a loan, if we can prove that everyone is on board for a sincere reinvention. And even the revenue generating programs we designed won’t pay off short term.

Epstein: You need tangibles.

Raad: The only tangible solution was M.Arch

Jamshed: Even if you downsize to $40 million, you have to sustain that. There’s inflation, in health care, etc. You can’t sustain that. No bargaining unit would agree to a 1.5% increase over 30 years.

Raad: Our donations will increase

Jamshed: Most gifts now are restricted funds, right now only about $3 million is unrestricted, to get to $15, it would be a 500% increase! There are estimates you can expect to raise by, 5, 6, maybe 7%. A 500% increase cannot be our plan. No one is capable of helping us at that scale. If you don’t think I’m making the pitch, I’ll bring you along and you can make the pitch. We don’t educate our students to become rich, nor should we. But then we have alumni who don’t give back. The largest living alumni donation is only $2 million. Other schools it is $30 million. We can’t just say “raise more money”

Epstein: And unless they went to Cooper, donors have their own schools to donate too.

Bordo: We have produced visible artists for years. That we do this is an untapped resource.

Driscoll: How do you tap it?

Bordo: One issue is that there is not enough art represented on the Board, no collectors, etc. When we talk to people in the art world and they the Board, they don’t know those people, it doesn’t look like them. Alex Katz was a resource.

Jamshed: Katz is on my presidential council, giving me names, but he also has issues with the school.

Bordo: The art school produces something the development office is not able to understand, based on my conversations.

Ellis: There is a descrepncy between the SOA faculty and Development. The art world is so peculiar, with peculiar morays, normal development strategies are not going to be effective. That’s why Katz was effective. There needs to be a conversation between students and faculty and development.

Driscoll: How do we engage faculty?

Bordo: We really are invested. Reiterates Sharons comment that we’re not trying to throw a wrench. We’re invested and willing.

Doug or Dennis (? DA again?) A story has to be crafted, and development can’t do it.

Jamshed: There are many stories. Yours is not the only one. Even Alex Katz’s is different. When I had lunch with him he said shut it down. There is a wide range of experiences people have about what Cooper is. There are many that agree with Mark Epstein. Yours is not the only narrative.

Epstein: We’re looking at every possible action. The other schools did, you started to, but stopped. Now we’re talking about Development. Development isn’t going to solve the problem.

Jamshed: Recently, one engineering alum gave a large donation to another instituion. I asked why and he said Cooper was no longer the leader in science. The story doesn’t raise money. Philanthropists see themselves as investors. And the oppurtunity for corrupting the integrity of the program is higher in philanthropy than in tuition. Donors ask all the time for favors in admission, for example, they say let this person in, and we say no, and they don’t donate.

Epstein: People don’t give you money because you need money. People give you money because they want to be a part of something, put their name on something.

Hayes: People in invest in art for different reason. This isn’t a single story, doesn’t have to be but there is an institutional need to come together and discuss both the differences and the singularities.

Epstein: Lets get back to what the SOA can do to get $ other than just asking. “Everyone wants progress but no one wants change”.

Adams: Development, okay we have them, we need to interface with professional development uniquely, so that they can speak about this with passion.

Jamshed: Donors expect professionalism and personal attention. You can’t speak to donors without this industry of professional development.

Ashford: What we do every day in art is break expectations, like these.

Epstein: I can’t go back to the Board after this meeting and tell them, “they just said raise more money”

Raad: We have said much more than that. Living within our means–

Epstein: This is not a simple question

Eagleton: I think what Prof Raad is getting at is that it’s not as simple as cutting classes, but also rethinking our relationship between the other schools, curricular issues, etc.

Raad: You cannot say ‘School of Art, this is your target $ amount’ it needs to be a discussion with the whole institution. To say cut or raise $ is too tense.

Jamshed: I parsed this into bits per school because this does not exist a joint faculty governance. Goes into talking about donors with different interests, gives example of some donor who didn’t want to donate after pro palestine event in great hall, you need to connect with people, the narrative needs to be as diverse as the donors.

Epstein: If there was a student on the board 5 years ago, where would we be now?

Ashford: There is momentum from the students and faculty, it can be used to create a new conversation with Development, in order to protect our primary asset and give us a different relationship to fundraising. The faculty is engaged, we keep describing the problem, it’s time to use the momentum

Jamshed: What you describe as the primary asset is not everyones.

Ashford: We’re here. Use us to create consensus.

Jamshed: Fact of the matter is, other meetings have spotty attendance, it is hard to get people involved. And you have to be prepared to listen to people with very different opinions.

Epstein: Is the primary asset the scholarship or the academic excellence? That’s the debate? Which is it?

Hayes: Another issue is that these programs would create a divide between students who pay and students who don’t. My experience teaching here is that there is something unique happening and you cannot categorically say you disagree with that.

Osinski: My son just graduated from an Ivy League school and it is a totally different culture, people talk about who is there on scholarship, who is a legacy, etc. It changes the social circles, the culture of the school.

Raad: Even in this room we come from very different places and we started this process not all agreeing at all. But we have come to consensus. We did not start there. The consensus is that merit based full tuition scholarships are the central thing which needs to be sustained. As Doug said, use us for another kind of consensus. There is consensus here.

Ellis: Let’s talk about how we are going to have this conversation. (referring to all-school wide conversation)

Jamshed: It is hard, getting people out of their schedules. People are committed to their individual schools. We have many conversations we don’t reach consensus.

At this point Epstein and deMenil and some faculty have to leave the meeting ends officially but people keep talking / my notes kind of fall apart.

Ashford expresses frustrations with scheduling being an issue: If this really is a sinking ship and the house is on fire, people will come, we can meet on a Saturday, if it’s really that bad, we can figure that out.

Hayes: If the issue and the urgency is made clear, there will be attendance. Perhaps there need to be preliminary meetings, or a series of meetings, we need to figure these things out.

Jamshed: We never reached consensus even in the Revenue Generating Task Force

Adams: The RTF was not the right type of representation, there were lots of outsiders and it was very corporate.

Jamshed: Not everyone agrees

Ashford: Dennis is not saying that in order to say it was a mistake, but that we need to figure out how to make this work, figure out the right type of representation.

Raad: You said yourself (to Jamshed) last week how long it took you to get here, to realize how bad things are. Things take time & conversation.

Jamshed talks about scheduling issues again how hard it is to have a conversation when people are on different schedules says he can’t solve our problems of representation.

More people leaving, meeting basically over. Casual discussion of how to frame next week’s all-school faculty meeting in order to get attendance, figure out topics of discussion, suggestions to the student reps to from dean Bos to try to organize something parallel with students from 3 schools.
