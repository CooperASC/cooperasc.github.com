## Q - Can we have a student representative to the Board of Trustees?
* People aren't allowed into BoT meetings because 
	* there is no time for them to speak
    * trustee meetings are confidential
* There is a perceived risk that if others were present, board members wouldn't be able to speak freely for fear of something being skewed. 

HOWEVER they still don't understand why there is a mistrust amongst the alumni and the students about the BoT. They absolutely refuse to see a need for direct (ie: someone who has a current relationship to the school, non-alumni) connection between the Board. We attempted, many many times, to articulate that the mistrust comes from the opacity of the BoT but they refused to believe that was the cause of mistrust. 

According to Mark and Francios, noone but the market is at fault for the current position of the cooper union.

Documentation from CDG will be released however there will not be an offical report

Rev. Task Force will be releasing their Final Report shortly

T.C. is willing to share 'many things' but not publicly or online

Jamshed - the administration needs to have a way to have a "family conversation" within the institution

Engineers have less objectionable stance toward undergraduate and graduate tuition, they have confidence in their dean and the taskforces to make good decisions and recommendations for the school

Mark - if the faculty aren't behind a decision, the school can't continue

They believe they've tried for decades to get the schools to come together but they understand they can't dicate what the schools should do so they're letting the schools find their own way, what's best for them

Jamshed supports bringing more tenured faculty on board (this was in response to Che's questions about only having 2 tenured arch faculty)

Jamshed believes the Art Faculty quickly embrassed talking about rev. generating grad programs where the Eng. faculty did not
