To the Board of Trustees: the following is not an acceptance of reducing the full-tuition undergraduate scholarship at The Cooper Union, rather it is a list of conditions we demand if the Board decides that undergraduate tuition will be charged. Over the last year and a half the goal of many in the Cooper community has been, solely, to preserve the full-tuition scholarships while looking for ways to balance the budget. Now--despite the work put in by the faculty of the three schools which was in all three aimed at preventing the reduction of the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships--we are being told that the full-tuition scholarships are still very much at risk.

We hold the full-tuition scholarships at the Cooper Union sacred not only because we have benefitted from them but because our school is a model for schools around the country and the world where students are stacked with debt when they graduate and, in spite of their expensive degree, can't even get a job. American higher education today is based on a model that is unsustainable because there is a disproportionate return on the investment in the form of $40,000 per year tuition. What is the 'structural deficit' of the average American college student when they graduate with so much debt? when they're 25? when they're 30?

There is a growing trend by young people in America today to not go to college or to drop out of college because this disproportionate return on their investment is so great.

Cooper Union graduates have the luxury of not graduating with $120,000 in debt. It's sad that, here, we call it a luxury when throughout Europe and the world free education is considered a right.

We do not consider charging undergraduate tuition a sustainable model for The Cooper Union or for the futures of the young people who will be made responsible for paying it and, therefore, hold ourselves to be guardians of this 

We would like to reaffirm our support for the mission statement of the school as it stands and be clear that we believe reducing the full-tuition undergraduate scholarship will undermine the integrity of the The Cooper Union and will adversely affect the excellence of the institution.

#Requirements to the BOT if tuition is imminent:

Dear members of the BOT,
we understand that, despite the proposals submitted (or soon to be submitted) by the three schools to generate tuition charging programs to save the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships, it is likely that the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships will still be reduced. If the BOT that this is necessary, we ask some things of you:

##Ensuring reversibility:
- That the establishment of a reduction of the full-tuition scholarships be done with a legal contract attached. The contract should not be longer than 5 years and when the contract is up, the school's full-tuition scholarships return. To renew the contract, the BOT should be obligated to work with the Cooper community, as soon as the contract to reduce the scholarship is signed, to develop a sustainable financial model that doesn't involve undergraduate tuition. We see undergraduate tuition at Cooper Union to be only a temporary measure to help us solve our structural deficit. 

##Explaining the numbers:
- That the BOT make available the total projected revenue from all the different revenue generating options selected and that the #s be broken down, explaining the projected revenue from each change (i.e. charging undergraduate tuition) and each BOT accepted program submitted by one of the three schools. 
- That the BOT explain the bare minimum new structural revenue needed to balance our budget (would be nice to see numbers for the next few five or so years and how inflation would change the number needed). 
- That the BOT, if the projected new structural revenue is greater than that bare minimum number, explain why that decision was made and what benefits that has.

##Explaining the choices:
- That the BOT issue a statement explaining why in addition to the programs outlined in the proposals from the three schools, why undergraduate tuition was still necessary.

##Explaining soon:
- That these things be made public in a timely manner, within two weeks of the Board's decisions. And that the process for drawing up the contract be announced to the Cooper community before it begins so that appropriate representatives may be selected by each of the constituencies.
