##Recommendations to the BOT if tuition is imminent:

Dear members of the BOT,
we understand that, despite the proposals submitted (or soon to be submitted) by the three schools to generate tuition charging programs to save the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships, that it is very likely that the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships will still be reduced. If that is the case, we ask some things of you:

- That the establishment of a reduction of the full-tuition scholarships be done with a contract attached. The contract should not be longer than 5 years and when the contract is up, the school's full-tuition scholarships return. To renew the contract, the BOT should be obligated to work with the Cooper community, as soon as the contract is signed, to develop a sustainable financial model that doesn't involve undergraduate tuition.
