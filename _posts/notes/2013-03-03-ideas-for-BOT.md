##Recommendations to the BOT if tuition is imminent:

Dear members of the BOT,
we understand that, despite the proposals submitted (or soon to be submitted) by the three schools to generate tuition charging programs to save the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships, it is very likely that the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships will still be reduced. If that is the case, we ask some things of you:

#Ensuring reversibility:
- That the establishment of a reduction of the full-tuition scholarships be done with a contract attached. The contract should not be longer than 5 years and when the contract is up, the school's full-tuition scholarships return. To renew the contract, the BOT should be obligated to work with the Cooper community, as soon as the contract to reduce the scholarship is signed, to develop a sustainable financial model that doesn't involve undergraduate tuition. 

#Explaining the numbers:
- That the BOT make available the total projected revenue from all the different revenue generating options selected and that the #s be broken down, explaining the projected revenue from each change (i.e. charging undergraduate tuition) and each BOT accepted program submitted by one of the three schools. 

#Explaining the choices:
- That the BOT issue a statement explaining why in addition to the programs outlined in the proposals from the three schools, why undergraduate tuition was still necessary.
