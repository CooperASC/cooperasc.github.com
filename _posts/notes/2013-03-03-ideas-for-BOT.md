To the Board of Trustees, the following is not an acceptance of charging undergraduate tuition at The Cooper Union, rather it is a list of conditions we demand if the Board decides that undergraduate tuition will be charged. Over the last year and a half, the goal of many in the Cooper community has been, solely, to preserve the full-tuition scholarships. Now--despite the work put in by the faculty of the three schools which in all three, primarily, aimed to prevent the reduction of the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships--we are being told that the full-tuition scholarships are still, very much at risk.

We hold the full-tuition scholarships at the Cooper Union not only because we have benefitted so greatly from them but because our great school is a model for schools around the country and the world where students are overwhelmed with debt when they graduate and can't even get a job to pay off their loans. American higher education today is based on an unsustainable model that is only getting worse.

We do not consider charging undergraduate tuition a sustainable model for The Cooper Union or for the futures of the young people who will be made responsible for paying it.

#Requirements to the BOT if tuition is imminent:

Dear members of the BOT,
we understand that, despite the proposals submitted (or soon to be submitted) by the three schools to generate tuition charging programs to save the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships, it is likely that the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships will still be reduced. We would like to reaffirm our support for the mission of the school and reiterate that we believe that charging undergraduate tuition undermines the integrity of the The Cooper Union and adversely effects the excellence of the institution. If charging tuition is still deemed necessary, we ask some things of you:

##Ensuring reversibility:
- That the establishment of a reduction of the full-tuition scholarships be done with a legal contract attached. The contract should not be longer than 5 years and when the contract is up, the school's full-tuition scholarships return. To renew the contract, the BOT should be obligated to work with the Cooper community, as soon as the contract to reduce the scholarship is signed, to develop a sustainable financial model that doesn't involve undergraduate tuition. We see undergraduate tuition at Cooper Union to be only a temporary measure to help us solve our structural deficit. 

##Explaining the numbers:
- That the BOT make available the total projected revenue from all the different revenue generating options selected and that the #s be broken down, explaining the projected revenue from each change (i.e. charging undergraduate tuition) and each BOT accepted program submitted by one of the three schools. 
- That the BOT explain the bare minimum new structural revenue needed to balance our budget (would be nice to see numbers for the next few five or so years and how inflation would change the number needed). 
- That the BOT, if the projected new structural revenue is greater than that bare minimum number, explain why that decision was made and what benefits that has.

##Explaining the choices:
- That the BOT issue a statement explaining why in addition to the programs outlined in the proposals from the three schools, why undergraduate tuition was still necessary.
