#To the Board of Trustees: 

the following is not an acceptance of reducing the full-tuition undergraduate scholarship at The Cooper Union, rather it is a list of conditions we request if the Board decides that undergraduate tuition will be charged. Over the last year and a half the goal of many in the Cooper community has been, solely, to preserve the full-tuition scholarships while looking for ways to balance the budget. Now--despite the work put in by the faculty of the three schools which was in all three aimed at preventing the reduction of the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships--we are being told that the full-tuition scholarships are still at risk.

We hold the full-tuition scholarships at the Cooper Union sacred not only because we have benefitted from them but because our school is a model for schools around the country and the world where students are stacked with debt when they graduate and, in spite of their expensive degree, can't even get a job. American higher education today is based on a model that is unsustainable because there is a disproportionate return on the $40,000 per year tuition investment. What is the 'structural deficit' of the average American college student when they graduate with so much debt? when they're 25? when they're 30? There is a growing trend by young people in America today to not go to college or to drop out of college for exactly this reason. 

Cooper Union graduates have the luxury of not graduating with $120,000 in debt. It's sad that, here, we call it a luxury when throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world tuition-free education is a right.

We do not consider charging undergraduate tuition a sustainable model for The Cooper Union as a institution of higher education in America, or for the futures of the young people who will take on the burden of expensive tuition and, therefore, we cannot imagine how Cooper Union will contribute positively to the future of higher education in America. 

We aspire to be a radical model to the world, to do in this millenium an updated version of what Peter Cooper did 150 years ago. We should not only be imaginative in our classrooms and progressive in our education, but also in the way we conceive how our schools are built and our governance is formed. This requires communication and generous collaboration between all of the constituencies that make up the Union, this is what we hope for. 

#Requirements to the BOT if tuition is imminent:

We understand that, despite the proposals submitted (or soon to be submitted) by the three schools to generate tuition charging programs to save the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships, it is likely that the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships will still be reduced. If the BOT determines--in spite of the work done by the community over the last year and a half to avoid exactly this--that reducing the full-tuition undergraduate scholarships is necessary, we ask some things of you:

##Ensuring reversibility:
- That the establishment of a reduction of the full-tuition scholarships be done with a legal contract attached. The contract should not be longer than 5 years and cannot be made longer. When the contract is up, the school's full-tuition scholarships return to students admitted the next fall. To be able to renew the contract, the BOT should be obligated to begin working with the Cooper community--as soon as the contract to reduce the scholarship is signed--to develop a sustainable financial model that doesn't involve undergraduate tuition. We see undergraduate tuition at Cooper Union to be only a temporary measure to give us time so that we may solve our structural deficit. 

##Explaining the numbers:
- That the BOT make available the total projected revenue from all the different revenue generating options selected and that the #s be broken down, explaining the projected revenue from each change (i.e. charging undergraduate tuition) and each BOT accepted program submitted by one of the three schools.
- That the BOT explain the bare minimum new structural revenue needed to balance our budget (would be nice to see numbers for the next five or so years and how inflation would change the number needed). 
- That the BOT, if the projected new structural revenue is greater than that bare minimum number, explain why that decision was made and what benefits that has.

##Explaining the choices:
- That the BOT issue a statement explaining why in addition to the programs outlined in the proposals from the three schools, why undergraduate tuition was still necessary.

##Explaining soon:
- That these things be made public in a timely manner, within two weeks of the Board's public announcement of their decisions, which we are expecting in late March. And that the plan to draw up the contract be announced to the Cooper community before it begins so that appropriate representatives may be selected by each of the constituencies.

##Explaining well:
- We encourage you to work with a graphic designer (we've got some great ones studying at Cooper) to make this information more legible to the Cooper community.
