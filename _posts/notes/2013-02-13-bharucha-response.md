On Wednesday, February 13th, 2013, President Bharucha released a statement to the Cooper Union community explaining that because of the School of Art Faculty's position that they can not support any proposal which would generate revenue from academic programs at the Cooper Union, the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees has instructed administration to notify students seeking early admission to the School of Art that their applications will be considered as part of the art school's general application pool. The Art Student Council, representing the school of Art Student Body, sees this action as an coercive threat targeting the School of Art, which unfairly punishes prospective students and their families, who applied under pretense that this years' admissions process would not be interrupted or affected by Cooper's financial crisis. This decision also unjustly punishes the numerous faculty and alumni who make up the admissions committee, who work tirelessly to uphold the School of Art's rigorous and unique merit based admissions process–which is in many ways the crux and genesis of the unique excellence found at Cooper–to the highest possible standards. 

The statement released by Bharucha further indicates to the Student Body that the President and Board of Trustees are incapable of listening to faculty members who have made it exceedingly clear in recent months that they do not seek to derail efforts to save the school, and in fact are ready and willing to participate, working well above and beyond what is asked of them, and continuously coming up with ideas for reinvention which would not violate the mission of the school. Stalling admission to early decision applicants, is a hollow threats which uses some of the best and brightest future Cooper students as collateral in order to penalize art faculty for refusing to cede to a hybrid model which would irreversibly compromise the mission of the school. The ASC feels that this is a blatant punishment towards the school of art, in part because the letter put forth by Bharucha fails to draw a logical connection between the Art Faculty's letter and Undergraduate Admissions.
