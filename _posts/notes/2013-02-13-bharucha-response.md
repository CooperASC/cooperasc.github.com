On Wednesday, February 13th, 2013, President Bharucha released a statement to the Cooper Union community explaining that because of the School of Art Faculty's position, which is that they can not support any proposal which would generate revenue from academic programs at the Cooper Union, the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees has instructed Mitchell Lipton, Dean of Admissions, to notify students seeking early admission to the School of Art that their applications will be deferred and considered as part of the art school's general application pool.

The Art Student Council, representing the School of Art student body, sees this action as a coercive threat to the School of Art and it's future. This action unfairly punishes prospective students and their families, who applied under the pretense that this year's admissions process would not be interrupted or affected by Cooper Union's financial crisis. This decision also unjustly punishes the many faculty and alumni who make up the admissions committee, and who work tirelessly to hold the School of Art's rigorous and unique merit-based admissions process--which is in many ways the crux and the origin of the unique excellence found at Cooper Union-—to the highest possible standards. The letter from *President* Bharucha further indicates the President and Board of Trustees inability to understand faculty who have made it clear in recent months that they do not aim to derail efforts to save the school and, instead, are ready and willing to participate and work far beyond what is ordinarily asked of them.
	This letter leads us to imagine two scenarios where the executive committee could have agreed to it: one where the Executive Committee has done this because there is a possibility that the School of Art will not be accepting students to start in 2013. The other where this is a hollow and coercive threat that aims to back the faculty of the School of Art into implementing tuition-charging graduate, summer, and post-baccalaureate programs they developed and then did not pass on to the Board of Trustees. If the former is true, then we would like to have a conversation about it, we would like to know that that is the case. And if the former is not true, then what is the point of the gesture? Who benefits from holding hostage the futures of applicants and their families? The Art Student Council sees this as a tactless and devious move on the part of the administration, which thoughtlessly potrays Cooper Union as an institution with a standard of excellence miles behind that which is continually upheld by the students, faculty and dean of the School of Art. 

The letter reads like a threat to us, and one which uses some of the best and brightest, prospective Cooper students as collateral in order to punish art faculty for refusing to accept a hybrid model which--our faculty and we firmly believe--would  compromise the mission of the school. By failing to draw a logical connection between the Art Faculty's letter and Undergraduate Admissions, the letter put forth by Bharucha indicates to us that the School of Art is being singled out and punished in the most cruel and unprecedented of ways. 

We need a good ending, guys. *Our ending must explicitly state our objective which is— from my understanding from reading our letter— to understand the logical link between withholding acceptance letters from prospective art students and The Administrations misunderstanding of the Art Schools intentions. The second paragraph is doing the best job of that right now.*
