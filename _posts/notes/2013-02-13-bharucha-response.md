On Wednesday, February 13th, 2013, President Bharucha released a statement to the Cooper Union community explaining that because of the School of Art Faculty's position, which is that they can not support any proposal which would generate revenue from academic programs at the Cooper Union, the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees has instructed Mitchell Lipton, Dean of Admissions, to notify students seeking early admission to the School of Art that their applications will be deferred and considered as part of the art school's general application pool.

The Art Student Council, representing the school of Art Student Body, sees this action as a coercive threat targeting the School of Art, and which unfairly punishes prospective students and their families, who applied under the pretense that this years' admissions process would not be interrupted or affected by Cooper's financial crisis. This decision also unjustly punishes the many faculty and alumni who make up the admissions committee, and who work tirelessly to hold the School of Art's rigorous and unique merit based admissions process–which is in many ways the crux and the origin of the unique excellence found at Cooper–to the highest possible standards. The letter from Bharucha further indicates that the President and Board of Trustees are incapable of listening to faculty members who have made it clear in recent months that they do not aim to derail efforts to save the school and, instead, are ready and willing to participate and work far beyond what is ordinarily asked of them.
	This letter leads us to imagine two scenarios where deferring admission is logical: one where the Board has done this because there is a possibility that the School of Art will not be accepting students to start in 2013 and the other where this is a hollow and coercive threat that aims to back the faculty of the School of Art into implementing the tuition-charging graduate, summer and post-baccalaureate programs they developed and then did not pass on to the Board of Trustees. If the former is true, then we would like to have a conversation about it, we would like to know that that is the case. And if the former is not true, then what is the point of the gesture? Who benefits from holding hostage the futures of applicants and their families like this and ______MORE WORDS______? It doesn’t make sense. It seems like it is more likely the latter.

This reads like a coercive threat to us, and one which uses some of the best and brightest future Cooper students as collateral in order to penalize art faculty for refusing to accept a hybrid model which--our faculty and we believe--would  compromise the mission of the school. The ASC feels that this is a punishment of the School of Art, but/ because **WHAT IS BEING SAID HERE???** the letter put forth by Bharucha fails to draw a logical connection between the Art Faculty's letter and Undergraduate Admissions. 

We need a good ending, guys.
