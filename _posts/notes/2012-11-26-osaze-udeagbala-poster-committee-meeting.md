#"Poster Committee" Meeting #2
###*now "Event Consolidation Committee"*
###*These notes were taken by Osaze Udeagbala*


### Summary: ditching idea of a physical poster with calendar of events on it in favor of simply directing students to the cooper.edu calendar of events. This requires getting the lecture series on that calendar online.

##Check-in with Kristof
* Spoke with Architecture Faculty for upcoming lecture events
* Suggestion: speak with the Webmaster (Andrew Arnold)

##Our Plan – get contacts and event info from the following facilities:
* Architecture - Oliver
* Art - Andy
* Engineering - Kristof
* Continuing Ed - Oliver
* HSS - Osaze
* Development Office - Kristof
* Alumni Association – Osaze

##Changing the name of the committee:
* Event Consolidation Committee – √

##Future Actions
