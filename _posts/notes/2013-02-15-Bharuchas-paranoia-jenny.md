An open letter to the community regarding our concern about President Bharucha's mounting paranoia:
Increasingly President Bharucha is showing us that he is very paranoid. He has increased building security (#s here, does anyone know how many security guards have been added and at what times. At least three different things 1: for checking ids, which Dean Lemiesz asked for 2: for certain meetings where board members are present and 3: when the occupiers were upstairs), 
President Bharucha had security guards go and check the dorm rooms that have windows overlooking the Hamilton Fish House.

He has referred to the creation of a "mob mentality" in the art school, indicating that he believes that, at any moment, the school could erupt into violence. 

These beliefs concern us because the actions taken and the things he has said simply are not an accurate representation and response to the things actually going on at the school. 

This concerns us a great deal because President Bharucha is the face of The Cooper Union and we feel that if these are the things he believes and feels, his representation of the school, the student body, and the temperature of the school to both the Board of Trustees and potential and long-time donors is far from accurate. We are concerned that President Bharucha is taking too much burden onto himself and is, as a result, causing him too much stress.
