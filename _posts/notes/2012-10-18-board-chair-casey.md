***

Before our first meeting I collected some thoughts and questions in writing:

- Discuss how better tools could help the administration _actually_ be accountable
- Discuss reducing the number of administrators we have and how much they're paid
- Find out more about board turnover
- Do you think it's worth paying for education? (Kind of a fluffy question, but I'd like to hear the trustees articulate what is _valuable_ about higher education, in relation to the _price_ it typically commands today.)
- What happens if the board rejects the hybrid model after it is presented to them by Jamshed on November 15th?
- Why have there been threats of closure? Especially to faculty and the dean of the engineering school? Is there anything in the school's charter about closure?
- What is the reputational risk of implementing tuition vs. closing schools temporarily for a multi-year reinvention?
- Why did Jamshed Bharucha, president of the school, get added to the board? Isn't that a conflict of interest? (He is supposed to present plans to the Board and _now_ gets to vote on them.)
- How much money does the board give to the school? Is it on par with other institutions?
- Can you address a rumor that approaching the attorney general to free up restricted funds from the endowment might jeopardize our arrangement with the Chrysler Building?

***

- Board of Trustees meets quarterly for about four hours.
- In response to Rachel's question about getting a student and faculty seat on the board Mark Epstein says board meetings are "necessarily confidential" because they throw out lots of bad ideas for discussion and don't want misinformation to spread. "Cooper is unique in many ways, not in governance."
- Not happy with [the Wall Street Journal article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124631610981670647.html) because it "downplayed the need for donations". The board has a communications committee
- Jamshed: "sharing within the family" because posting everything on the internet might jeopardize sensitive negotiations with financial, legal, and philanthropic institutions
- Mark Epstein: where does the distrust come from?
- Administrative vs. instructional costs report from T.C.
- Mauricio didn't like what [Peter Cafiero](http://cooper.edu/about/trustees/peter-cafiero) had to say on the day students went into the board meeting
- Jamshed: "sometimes the truth makes you cry, Mauricio"
- Jamshed briefed student council members very early on about "the plan which came to be known as the Hybrid Model". Communication breakdown between student council and student body or problem of representation?
- Mark Epstein: putting a student on the board is not going to happen. You need to learn to accept a "no".
- Mauricio wants to talk about Cooper "beyond the numbers", ME "we can't get beyond numbers". Money in and money out.
- Mark Epstein: "What if we kept the school free but it was like a community college?"
- [Kristof Toth](http://esc.cooper.edu/repinfo.php?repname=toth): we respect our representatives, again with the idea of talking more in smaller rooms, we respect reps, diff
- Mark Epstein: that things where 97% of students gave a penny? Not cute and insulting.
- Cy Pres
- In the [Engineering Student Council meeting I sat in on](http://esc.cooper.edu/minutes.php?id=24) "We called Olin and Rice about their switch to charging some tuition, they said they saw a dip in student quality (like average SAT score) in the beginning, but then they rebounded back. The tuition values we would look at are substantially below those of neighboring schools."
- Mark Epstein: our alumni are not wealthy enough to fund us so we have to look for alternatives
- Mark Epstein: Foundations don't want to give money to Cooper because some of the scholarhips it would fund go to students who could afford to pay
- Francois de Menil: the faculty are the heart and soul of the school
- Ché Pérez (Architecture Student Council): Because our model is so unqiue, what if we positioned Cooper at the center of the dialogue on education, and focused on hosting events and programs about education?
- Mark Epstein: That creates value, yes. But value isn't cash. Value doesn't pay the bills.
- Mark Epstein: The Board doesn't get involved with curriculum. "Noses in, fingers out." The budget is worked out by the present.
- Che: School of Architecture only has two tenured faculty. So budget has a direct affect on curriculum.
- Jamshed agrees that the school should have more teneured faculty.
- Lawrence Cacciatore: The board has passion! The level of access we're getting — for example in this meeting — is unprecedented.
- Casey Gollan: But it's not enough.
- Mark Epstein: Cooper's Board hired consultants to tell them how they can be a better board. They reccomended changes such as much shorter terms for trustees, so the board reduced them a little bit.
