Before our first meeting I collected some topics to discuss:

- Discuss how better tools could help the administration actually be accountable and transparent
- Discuss reducing the number of administrators we have and how much they're paid
- Find out more about board turnover

And I asked a few people if they had questions I could throw out, in addition to my own:

- Do you think it's worth paying for education? (Kind of a fluffy question, but I'd like to hear the trustees articulate what is _valuable_ about higher education, in relation to the _price_ it typically commands today.)
- What happens if the board rejects the hybrid model after it is presented to them by Jamshed on November 15th?
- Why have there been threats of closure? Especially to faculty and the dean of the engineering school? Is there anything in the school's charter about closure?
- What is the reputational risk of implementing tuition vs. closing schools temporarily for a multi-year reinvention?
- Why did Jamshed Bharucha, president of the school, get added to the board? Isn't that a conflict of interest? (He is supposed to present plans to the Board and _now_ gets to vote on them.)
- How much money does the board give to the school? Is it on par with other institutions?
- Can you address a rumor that approaching the attorney general to free up restricted funds from the endowment might jeopardize our arrangement with the Chrysler Building?

Present at the meeting: [Mark Epstein](http://cooper.edu/about/trustees/mark-epstein), [Francois de Menil](http://cooper.edu/about/trustees/francois-de-menil), [Jamshed Bharucha](http://cooper.edu/about/president-bharucha), [Lawrence Cacciatore](http://cooper.edu/people/lawrence-cacciatore), [Casey Gollan](/people/casey-gollan/) (Art Student Council), [Rachel Appel](/people/rachel-appel/) (Art Student Council), Mauricio Higuera (Student in School of Art), Che Perez (Architecture Student Council), [Kristof Toth](http://esc.cooper.edu/repinfo.php?repname=toth) (Engineering Student Council)

- Good to know: the Board of Trustees meets quarterly for about four hours.

## Transparency

- **Can we have access to the Board's meeting minutes?**  
Mark: board meetings are "necessarily confidential" because board members throw out lots of bad ideas for discussion and don't want misinformation to spread.
- **The administration claims to strive for transparency but anybody who goes digging far enough, finds that the school won't provide specific information or there are bottlenecks.** 
Jamshed: we can only share within the "Cooper family" because posting everything on the internet could jeopardize sensitive negotiations with financial, legal, and philanthropic institutions

- Lawrence Cacciatore: The board has passion! The level of access we're getting — for example in this meeting — is unprecedented.
- Casey Gollan: But it's not enough.

## Communication

- Mark wasn't happy with [the Wall Street Journal article](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124631610981670647.html) because it "downplayed the need for donations". The Board formed a communications committee.
- Mark: where does the distrust come from?
- Mauricio didn't like what [Peter Cafiero](http://cooper.edu/about/trustees/peter-cafiero) had to say on the day students were invited into a board meeting after dangling dollar bills outside. Jamshed responds: "sometimes the truth makes you cry, Mauricio."

## Value and Cash

- Mauricio tried repeatedly to talk about Cooper "beyond the numbers", Mark responds "we can't get beyond numbers". Mark says that there are many complicated ways to do accounting but he has two columns: money in and money out.
- Jamshed briefed student council members very early on about "the plan which came to be known as the Hybrid Model". Communication breakdown between student council and student body or problem of representation?

- Ché Pérez (Architecture Student Council): Because our model is so unqiue, what if we positioned Cooper at the center of the dialogue on education, and focused on hosting events and programs about education?
- Mark Epstein: That creates value, yes. But value isn't cash. Value doesn't pay the bills.

## Control

- Mark: "Cooper is unique in many ways, not in governance." Putting a student on the board is "not going to happen." "You need to learn to accept a no."

- T.C. has a report on administrative vs. instructional costs. We should check this out.

- Kristof: we respect our representatives, again with the idea of talking more in smaller rooms, we respect reps, diff
- Mark Epstein: that things where 97% of students gave a penny? "Not cute...insulting."
- Cy Pres
- In the [Engineering Student Council meeting I sat in on](http://esc.cooper.edu/minutes.php?id=24) "We called Olin and Rice about their switch to charging some tuition, they said they saw a dip in student quality (like average SAT score) in the beginning, but then they rebounded back. The tuition values we would look at are substantially below those of neighboring schools."
- Mark: our alumni are not wealthy enough to fund us so we have to look for alternatives. If the message of giving back isn't working, maybe we should talk about "giving forward."
- Mark: Cooper's Board hired consultants to tell them how they can be a better board. They reccomended changes such as much shorter terms for trustees, so the board reduced them a little bit.

## Cooper's Future

- In response to repeated comments from students about the importance of Cooper's scholarship, Mark underscored that he thinks Cooper's key quality is not its scholarship but its excellence. "What if we kept the school free but it was like a community college?"
- Mark says that philanthropic foundations don't like the school's merit-based admission policy because they aren't comfortable funding scholarships given to students that could afford to pay otherwise.

- Francois de Menil: the faculty are the heart and soul of the school

- Mark Epstein: The Board doesn't get involved with curriculum. "Noses in, fingers out." The budget is worked out by the present.
- Che: School of Architecture only has two tenured faculty. So budget has a direct affect on curriculum.
- Jamshed agrees that the school should have more teneured faculty.
