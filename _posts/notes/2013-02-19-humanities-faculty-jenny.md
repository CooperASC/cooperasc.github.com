pretty short, Peter Buckley and Dore Ashton are taking sabbaticals next semester and will return in Spring of 2014, HSS is anticipating that they will be working with flat budget for the next fiscal year. On Web Advisor: It is "a system we all agree is a work in progress." Dean Germano explained that, regarding next year, there is a lot happening and considerable anxiety. and if there are any drastic changes in enrollment next year, that will affect us greatly. If we have fewer first-year studetns, we will need fewer first-year core courses. The Dean also commended the work that has been done on the new HTA101 and 102 courses.

4. Reports from the schools
5. Report on proposed revisions to HSS governance
David Weir, a member of the subcommittee of the HSS Administrative Committee responsible for revising the governance of the HSS faculty reported that they are going to suggest that the governance be rewritten to reflect the two kinds of contracts. They also suggested that the HSS Faculty elect a parliamentarian. Weir reminded the committee that any revisions of the governance would involve a vote of the faculty. And then after that the President must approve the changes.

6. Report on Fulbright

8. Remarks from President Bharucha (Approximately 1:00 pm)
JB reminds us that he is a member of the HSS faculty.
"I think the thing that we're actually all here for to support the work of our students."
Student Eagleton asks JB if he can talk about the role of the HSS faculty in his "reinvention" plan and why they weren't included in the August charge for reasons other than the obvious 'it's not a degree granting school.'

JB says that he sees the humanities at "the core of learning" and "at the core of what it means to educate a person" he would like to see more Humanities requirements for students in the three schools. But the future of the school is "certainly a tricky thing to think through" and will require "a lot more strategic planning." JB would like to see more integration of HSS into the other schools and mentions that "there is a broad cry from students and faculty alike to have more cross-disciplinary" efforts. JB sees HSS Faculty being greatly involved in the "academic planning" of the institution.

Eagleton explained that she was asking about the role of the HSS Faculty, rather than in terms of "academic planning," "financial planning." i.e. why weren't the HSS Faculty included in the charge made by JB in August.

JB: "I didn't see a clear way that the HSS Faculty could be given a charge in this way" "HSS did vote to affirm awarding full-tuition scholarships to all admitted students." (ME: THIS IS TRUE, THE VOTE HAPPENED LAST SPRING AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER IN AN HSS FULL FACULTY MEETING.) "Given that, I didn't see how I could charge the Humanities Faculty with generating revenue generating programs."

Some faculty mentioned that they put together the Summer Writing Program and could develop a professional writing program, perhaps a certificate or degree? This has not really been discussed.

JB reinforced his earlier point that because the HSS Faculty voted to reaffirm the mission statement last year then how could they create new programs because "you can't create new programs without charging."






"Ok, The SOA faculty did a thing and you did this in response and the thing you did in response is...not positive, how is that not punitive?!"

and he said: "the, the, the trustees are not, and, y'know, at this point, y'know, they, uhhhh, the board is taking ownership of this, I can tell you very categorically, the SOA can not see itself admitting another class without a funding model. It's just not gonna happen."
