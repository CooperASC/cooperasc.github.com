School of Art Administrative Committee Meeting Tuesday 2/12/13
Notes by: Jenny Eagleton

Discussion about meeting previous Tuesday w/ faculty, dean, students, president and board members. 

On the issue of $, charging tuition:
"we make contracts with students, not their parents. THe excellence comes from this contract based in merit and not in need."

Early Decision will be postponed until March when the Board of Trustees meet.

Is this a punishment? Why is it specific to SOA? What is the purpose?
