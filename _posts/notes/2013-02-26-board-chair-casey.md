## Agenda

- [**Bylaw Archives**](http://github.com/caseyg/bylaws)
	- Thanks for providing them!
    - There are still missing pieces.
    - This kind of transparency and realtime archiving can be integrated directly into administrative workflows.
- **ASC Website and Transparency Initiative**
	- As seen in [_The New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/nyregion/cooper-unions-tradition-of-free-tuition-may-be-near-end.html?pagewanted=all)!
    - Diligent record-keeping and consistent openness via Student Council is something I  continue to advocate for and work on. We face an endless stream of fear, uncertainty, and doubt about it from some people — and there is a legitimate need to be sensitive and thoughtful about people's concerns — but so far I've seen only unprecedented excitement and involvement.
    - We're using Git-backed systems that [expose all changes and record all history](https://github.com/CooperASC/cooperasc.github.com/commits/master) in the background as we work. This is not only accountable in terms of meeting notes, but cool to watch as we collaboratively author documents.
- **Early Decision Deferral**
	- [ASC Response to President Bharucha's Letter](http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2013/02/13/bharucha-response/)
    	- "If the Board does not plan to admit a class to the School of Art due to a misunderstanding, we would like to know that that is the case and have a conversation about it. If that is not the point of this mass-deferral, then Art Student Council would like to know: what is?"
	- "Why is there a lack of trust?" is [a question that has been raised](http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2012/10/18/board-chair-casey/) by Mark in previous Board Chair meetings. Bringing in the Hometest prompts and some real Hometests to understand on a personal level the level of commitment these students had to Cooper and how trust has been broken with them.
    - Why did the administration hastily send [a PR blast](http://cusos.org/response-to-135pm-statement-from-claire-mccarthy-to-press/) directly to press 30 minutes into a student rally for deferred applicants? If there are, as President Bharucha [has stated](http://cooperasc.github.com/notes/2013/02/05/resident-faculty-president-and-trustee-meeting/), many narratives, why is there only one — the voice of the students — that the administration continues to preempt?
- **Board and Administration Transparency Check-In**
	- Where is the [Board Report](http://cooper.edu/about/trustees/reports) from December? It has been 83 days since the meeting with nothing posted.
	- I met with Lawrence Cacciatore on January 24th and he told me that:
    	- The "late-January decision-making meeting" that Jamshed had alluded to in a December email didn't happen, and it was not going to happen in January because "everything has been postponed".
        - How the timeline has shifted cannot be disclosed in terms of specific dates.
		- Board meeting dates, times, and locations will no longer be disclosed and they were never intentionally public information.
    	- The list of which trustees are on which committees is not public information.
        - The group of trustees reviewing the Reinvention proposals hadn't met yet, wasn't finalized, and it is not public information who is on it.
        - Many rules are unwritten, such as the Executive Committee's sub-bylaws. (Operating via unwritten rules in a situation where our level of access is so low isn't right.)
- **Faculty/Student Board Representation**
	- In a faculty / CUFCT meeting Stock was asked about a justification for not having faculty on the board that there is some kind of union-related issue and he denied it. the union is open to negotiation.
    - A petition for student representation on the board had reached 434 signatures as of January 22nd.
