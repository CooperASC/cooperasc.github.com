The Faculty of the School of Art requested that Art Student Council not post public notes from this meeting. The outcome of this meeting was the following vote, announced in an [administrative press release](http://cooper.edu/about/news/update-academic-and-financial-planning):

> The Faculty of The School of Art votes to endorse the vote taken by the Full-time faculty on Feb. 28, 2013, which was forwarded to the Dean of the School of Art, the President, and the Board of Trustees, and votes to adopt the attached proposals.

We've updated our [Statement on Transparency](http://cooperasc.github.com/about/transparency/) to provide a more explicit explanation of situations where we don't post notes.
