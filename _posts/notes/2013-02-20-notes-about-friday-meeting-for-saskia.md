HEY GUYS, we need to make a list of topics to set up Saskia for Friday!

1. What’s with the security. can you tell us how much it’s costing. Why are they patrolling?

2. where to go from here

what efforts are being made to oppose and actively seek solutions?

Conversation about how we can/ can we live within our means?

walids point about $40m, and his school running on 10-12m
how can we grow down?

we've been tryin to answer this since forever ago
can the art school grow down within itself only? in a fair way?

can we save ourselves separate form the others?

3. what kind of reactions she feels are coming from the administration
how much heat she's personally taking that we don't know about
How if at all she can convey that or create a process where those board/admin complaints are voiced to students so we can respons and not just to people like Day and Saskia bearing the brunt.
I'm tired to the board justifying that saskia doesnt have a "handle" of us or that if Day wasn't picking the admissions the applicants wouldnt be writing these things.
or like what a successful action/result would be in her eyes- i know she seemed happy with yesterday.

but it feels like the art school is stuck in a reactionary/defensive position and it would be great to know if she thinks its possible to get out from under this and what it woud look like
