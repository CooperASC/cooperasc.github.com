Dear members of the Cooper Union Community

With the spring semester well underway, I want to take this opportunity to 
provide an update on our academic and financial planning, and to invite you 
to a Community Forum with Trustees on March 1st. 

Following the Board of Trustees meeting in December, the Chairman appointed 
a Reinvention Review Committee of the Board to review all proposals to address
Cooper Union's financial condition, including the reports that were developed 
by the faculty.  This committee will make recommendations to the full Board.  
Last semester I indicated that the Board would make important decisions about 
the future of the Cooper Union sometime in late January.  That timeframe has 
been adjusted to late March, to allow for a thorough review of options and a 
careful analysis of risks and opportunities.  The guiding principles in this 
process match the principles I laid out to the academic deans and faculty in 
August - our plans must be financially sustainable while also building a 
future characterized by academic excellence and a distinctive vision. Since 
at least the late 1960s (as evidenced by a report by President White and 
dramatically curtailed real growth in Chrysler revenues in the 1990s), 
Cooper's principal funding source (revenue from the Chrysler building) has 
not kept up with inflation. This shrinking funding source triggering a series 
of steps to downsize, including parting with the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, Green 
Camp, physics degree programs and a variety of assets. We now must make the 
tough decisions necessary to build a sustainable future without kicking the 
can further down the road.

As you may recall from my memo in December, the Faculties of the Albert 
Nerken School of Engineering and the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture 
have forwarded their reports to me, and I have forwarded them to the Board 
for study and analysis. The Faculty of the School of Art, while endorsing 
the excellence of the programs they developed over the Fall semester and 
presented orally to the Board on December 5 (these include pre-college, 
summer, certificate and master's programs), has reversed its course and on 
January 25th issued a statement to me and Dean Bos, and later to the Board 
of Trustees, stating that they "can neither propose nor vote on a motion 
that moves these proposals forward," stating that "any solution to The 
Cooper Union's current financial crisis that depends, even in part on tuition 
compromises and irreversibly damages the ideals of art, education, freedom, 
and citizenship". Pending the Board's decisions in March about the future 
of the institution, and in the absence of a sustainable model for the School 
of Art, the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees has directed the 
administration to notify students seeking early admission to the School of Art 
that their applications will be considered as part of the art school's general 
application pool. We apologize to our early admission applicants to the School 
of Art for the delay in the decision process.

The Board of Trustees Community Forum on March 1st will convene at 6:00 PM in 
The Great Hall.  The Forum will be a structured opportunity for students, 
faculty, staff and alumni to ask questions of trustees before decisions are 
made. Dean Stephen Baker, Cooper Union's newest honorary alumnus, will convene 
and introduce the event.  I encourage you to attend.  

I want to thank everyone in our community who has contributed ideas to the 
reinvention process.  With challenge comes the opportunity. We will get through 
this and come out poised for a vibrant future.

Jamshed Bharucha
President
